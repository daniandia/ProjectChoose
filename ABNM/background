A Brave New Mod

High Concept
============

Summary
-------

A video game about radical changes in society brought by cybernetics and biotechnology (The Bio-Cyber revolution). The game starts when the biggest private research corporation releases so radical products to the market the world governments feel forced to censor all information and ban the outright sale of any biotech.  

The game will from the perspective of a "regular civilian" with a boring low-level corporate job that increasingly participates in an underground world of illegal fights and crime. He illegally modifies its body (which always has positive and negative consequences) in order to progress towards its objective and in its career in the crime underworld.

Gameplay
--------

"Choose your own adventure" with attributes, randomness in the resolution of the events. hidden events, short text accompanied by images. Every scene is a image+short text scene, with different 

The first episode starts at the very beginning of the bio-cyber revolution. The protagonist managed to get a high quality body modification just before they are banned (Strength, Swiftness or Empathy), then hooked gets another lower quality one (similar qualities) that triggers a debilitating side effect and exausts all its money. Being hospitalized by its objective (Finding a Cure, Transcending Humanity, Lust for Power) he will start dipping his feet in the crime underworld while trying to keep his increasingly soul-crushing but comfortable regular corporate job.   


Background
==========

No one considered a fellow citizen with an artificial heart or even a fancy artificial limb "a cyborg" or "a mod" until three events in quick succession destroyed the fabric of society: 

1  

"We have become Demigods" - Bart Dixey, on his first post-cryo govtube interview 

Bart Dixey, excentric technologist and trillionaire, was unfrozen by his custodians after 135 years in cryogenic stasis and declared that his company decades long search for inmortality and eternal youth was at an end. Frozen when he had just turned 53 years old, at 183 years old he was the oldest (unfrozen) human on Earth, but looked more like an eerie sibling of his grandson. The wealthy were now potentially immortal. 

2

"They looked more like monstrous machines than humans" - Alice Foo, survivor of the EU Massacre 

Unnarmed, but heavily modified Abrahamic Fundamentalists strangled and mauled to death several random civilians and proceeded to self-destruct in crowded urban centers, with a death toll of 2476 citizens in an impossibly coordinated terrorist attack all across the European Federation. 

3 

"Body Modifications are a threat to the Human Race and Global governments" - Adim Adepoju, United Nations Secretary General

Mayor biotech corporations attempt to expand in the body modification market was thwarted when, in a rare announcement by the 4 Superpowers (The European Federation, The Afro-American Commonwealth, The Maorian Free Nations and the Japanese Empire) illegalized unsanctioned body modifications across the globe.
